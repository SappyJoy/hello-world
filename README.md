# hello-world

Hi guys, I know this language kinda bad, BUT I what to say you, that I whould try to learn it, because I want to understand english speakers. I'm learning programming since 2nd or 3rd class in my school and now I'm going to be a student in ITMO University from this year. So... All that I would say... I'm tired. I don't know what i should do right now. The only thing I know that I love music, and I want write it and listen it. Thank you my dad and mom.
